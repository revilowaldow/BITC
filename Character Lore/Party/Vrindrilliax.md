## Traits

***Draconic Essence.*** When you summon the drake, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. The chosen type determines the drake's damage immunity and the damage of its Infused Strikes trait.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 plus PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: `1d6` plus PB piercing damage.

## Reactions

***Infused Strikes.*** When another creature within 30 feet of the drake that it can see hits a target with a weapon attack, the drake infuses the strike with its essence, causing the target to take an extra `1d6` damage of the type determined by its Draconic Essence.
