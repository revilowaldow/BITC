> #### The Battle at Looming Rock

The Helviti Wastelanders don't have many defining battles due to their disparate clan-like nature. For this reason, the Battle of Looming Rock, also known as the battle of the Five Comanda, stands out. Serving the [Aegan Empire](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,1,the%20aegan%20empire,0), the Lion Comanda and the Devil Comanda both marched against an army from the [Northern Kingdoms](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,1,the%20northern%20kingdoms,0) alongside an Aegan force. Sensing imminent victory, the [Aegan Empire](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,1,the%20aegan%20empire,0) rescinded their contract with the Helviti just prior to the final battle at Looming Rock.

In order to protect their reputation and prevent similar breaches in contract from other nations, Lion and Devil Comanda both sent a call to the Topaz, Horsehair, and Whistle Comanda who were in the region. Through deft manoeuvering and sudden surprise, they were able to annihilate a full half of the Aegan force, though this came at the cost of the Lion Comanda.

Sensing defeat and dreading the complete loss of the Aegan army, the Aegan Commander at the time quickly ordered the Helviti to be paid in full. Through quick communication and expert coordination, the Helviti switched sides once again and cornered the [Northern Kingdoms](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,1,the%20northern%20kingdoms,0) army, unaware of the turmoil between the Helviti and the Aegan armies.

The battle ended as a pyrrhic victory for the Aegan forces, who had lost such a substantial portion of their forces to Helviti harrying from the Horsehair and Whistle Comanda that their aspirations to march on the [Northern Kingdoms](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,1,the%20northern%20kingdoms,0) were irreparably halted. The Helviti had cemented their reputation as a force not to be crossed. The Devil Comanda continues to serve the [Aegan Empire](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,1,the%20aegan%20empire,0), who relies heavily on their service and continues to pay them handsomely to this day.
