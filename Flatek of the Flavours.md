Single-stringed instrument played by shifting the bridge for an accompanying vibrato effect as well as pinching the string with a heavy bronze bar that shifts the notes. Easy to pick up but complicated to master.

The Flatek of the Four Schools is adorned with bronze ornamentation depicting various acts of cookery. The symbols and depictions are intended to represent the harmony with the four established schools of cooking at the city of Kathkach. It was gifted to Urtabu Broyl, Palanda Macav's predecessor by a Parchian magus. Palanda, unable to play the Flatek, paid the instrument less heed than his predecessor.

A character can attempt to attune to the Flatek of the Four Schools by trying to play the instrument for an hour on a full stomach. The character must then make a DC 10 Arcana check to attune to the instrument. If the character has proficiency in a stringed instrument, they automatically succeed this check. On a failed save, the attunement fails, and attunement cannot be attempted until the next dawn.

When attuned to the Flatek of the Four Schools, the user can use an action to play the Flatek of the Four Schools and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use a DC of 13 (+5 to hit) where applicable; all spells are cast at level 1.

Fuel of the Fry: The wielder casts the spell Grease.

Haze of the Smokery: The wielder casts the spell Fog Cloud.

Pain of the Pickle: The wielder casts the spell Chromatic Orb (acid damage only).

Ceremony of the Infusion: The wielder casts the Sanctuary spell.

Whilst attuned to the Flatek of the Four Schools, the character is proficient in playing the Flatek if they were not already.
