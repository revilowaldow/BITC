Murders in [[Lowtown]]
- Politically motivated? 
- Ritualistic kills

Victims disappear from the streets during the night
Witness reports of shadowy figure carrying a silver blade - [[The Silver Blade]]

Bodies are found later cut up in religious ways

[[Town Militia]] have a preserved killing near the [[Low Harbour]] which we can visit
	Just outside [[Sea Blooded Organisation]]'s headquarters

Guard - How's [[Nefros]]


Warehouse, large empty warehouse

Human male, flies
On back, visible cuts and injuries

[[Amaranth Hand]]'s guide suggests familiarity, look at the cuts
Cuts made with a unique blade, multiple edges
Body laid out in a religious way, tendons cut to let limb be placed unnaturally

Looks like a Kathkachan Rune in terms of shape

Need to talk to a religious leader maybe 

Body was moved to current location 

Symbol of a banned cult

Old gods - [[Aepoptosis]] - god of death violence destruction

[[Cobalt Comanda]] can become involved if murders spread to the merchant district

Symbol:
Library notes on [[Aepoptosis]] Primal god of violence brutality, dying and death
Predates the fall
City of [[Kathkach]] is old and was built
First Founding was under [[Brayk Brasshand]] and offered tribute to [[Aepoptosis]]
Ritual and rites were performed including bloody sacrifice and gladiatorial combat
Arenas supported this now ladies library, on houses cobalt Comanda, one is still arena, one is submerged, one is abandoned
