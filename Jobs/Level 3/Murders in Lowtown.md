Murders in [[Lowtown]]
- Politically motivated? 
- Ritualistic kills

Victims disappear from the streets during the night
Witness reports of shadowy figure carrying a silver blade - [[The Silver Blade]]

Bodies are found later cut up in religious ways

[[Town Militia]] have a preserved killing near the [[Low Harbour]] which we can visit
	Just outside [[Sea Blooded Organisation]]'s headquarters

Guard - How's [[Nefros]]


Warehouse, large empty warehouse

Human male, flies
On back, visible cuts and injuries

[[Amaranth]]'s guide suggests familiarity, look at the cuts
Cuts made with a unique blade, multiple edges
