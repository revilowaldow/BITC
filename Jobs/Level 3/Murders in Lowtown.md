Murders in [[Lowtown]]
- Politically motivated? 
- Ritualistic kills

Victims disappear from the streets during the night
Witness reports of shadowy figure carrying a silver blade - [[The Silver Blade]]

Bodies are found later cut up in religious ways

[[Town Militia]] have a preserved killing near the [[Harbour]] which we can visit
