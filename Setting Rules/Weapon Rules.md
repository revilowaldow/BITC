# Weapon Materials (Standard)

### Bronze

Bronze is a pliable but versatile material. If an attack using a bronze melee weapon misses by more than 5, the weapon becomes bent. As an action, the weapon can be bent back into shape. Whilst bent, any attack roll is done at a 1d4 penalty. If the weapon is bent again in this way whilst already bent, it becomes broken.

### Heliotropic Bronze

### Iron

Iron is a hard, brittle material. If an attack using an iron weapon misses by more than 8, the weapon is chipped, and suffers a -1 to damage rolls. This is cumulative each time the weapon becomes chipped, up to -3. If the iron weapon is chipped after that, the weapon breaks. Chips can be removed by sharpening and maintaining the weapon with a whetstone or similar tool for 30 minutes during a short or long rest.

### Steel

Steel is a bright, light material that maintains a good edge. Due to its balance, attacks made with a steel weapon have +1 to hit, and their maintenance is negligible.

### Organic

Many weapons, especially those found in the wilderness, can be made of teeth, claws, wood, stone, or any other material readily available. Due to the haphazard nature of these weapons, they are often prone to malfunction but can cause nasty wounds. An organic weapon suffers a -1 to hit, but a +1 to damage rolls. If an organic weapon does more than 15 damage in one hit, it falls apart. Attacks done with a weapon that has fallen apart in this way have disadvantage. An organic weapon that has fallen apart can be repaired over 30 minutes with the appropriate tools.
