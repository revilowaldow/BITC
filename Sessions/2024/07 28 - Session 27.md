[[Terrence]]

Small cave, stone altar, cultists

Old man, wrinkled, stern, very large longbow, impressive arrows, large cave, underground ancient ruins, barking, keep out sign, cool air, different corridor

Older slender bookish figure, near to Kana
Large dark bearded bandit, flag with black kathkach coin
Cultist, impressive facial tattoos, smiling and knife
Voices, shut out

Cool breeze
Decay rot sweat, wooden club
Mushrooms damp

Sparring in large room, dozen bandits sparring training

Voices in his head, repressed, recollection of large chamber, buried towers, dog feet
Kana is in the pool with her doctor
Voices speaking through water or a wall

One sounds older, gravellier, malicious
confident suave voice
Woman's voice, speaks least, commanding

Large cages made of wood, 5 people at a time, chanting, arenas

> Look for sister, 5 years younger shorter, dark hair [[Rev]]
