Longbow
Steel Shortsword
7 Longer than normal well crafted arrows
Pouch 25gp 
Round Stone by the bed the same as the marble orb 

Muffled aristocratic voice echoes through room from orb
Male voice
Heard before
The voice said it would let the others know the orb is now off limits

Others on the orb
	Derision
	Caution
	Strategy
An alliance of convenience, amused and resigned

Kana
	Anger and sadness
	Priests

They will keep fighting without me and disband as a guerilla force

Collapsed tunnel

See party members in golden armour
Tattoos glowing
Thodun stone skin scales
Vrin lots of lightning

Sun seems less bright, smell of smoke

Brush fire

Purple hue of air
