Alex is recapping.

Middle of a fight!

![[Lachaka Street Chase.png]]

[[Aepoptosis]] cult related to dog prince taking villages?

Saved Jokku, has knowledge in brain

Turned around, large ruined pier
	Double back big street centre of town
	Some hollow buildings that may once have had bandits, doused fire

Large number of corpses in warehouse

Overheard conversation between scarred bandit and bandits
Wait for rescue force, which would prevent us being elsewhere
What else has been attacked??

Villages
Grain raid

Bandits acting like insurgents

Lead bandit [[Kana]]
	Many bandages
	Fighting style very similar to Helviti fighting styles


Need to follow up on purple powder

Dreams:
	Caenis
		cooking for Kathkatchan elite
		Lady who took his shop watching jealously
		Last name not on store 
	Vrin dull dark sensation of space
		curled up in egg
		Three voices, two human, one deep regal booming
	Thodunn
		Elves fighting in rocks
		killed in rockfall
		[[Kana]] killing vrin
		injuries sustained
		kaulinan on floor
		[[Kana]] and fighting what could he have done better
	Aru
		Vrin being tossed off podium, anger hatred sadness fear
		Vrin being held, dread of loss and warmth glowing as Vrin is healed
		"But those who understand the bond that tie two comrades"
		Vrin eyes opening joy and happiness
	Jokku
		Ingots rainbow arrayed, overjoyed
		boat upside down in barbakn
		looking for ores
		clawed grip grasps his shoulder
		eyes of [[Kana]]
		cruel violet glint in her eyes
		eyes fixate on me
		something else wearing the body 

Attempt to push into [[Kana]]'s mind
Physically painful to push deeper
Burning purple star
Think I've seen this before but can't tell where
Overwhelmed with not just [[Kana]], things battles and wars I don't recognise

Report to Kev, immediately travel to see [[Shiendo Kadan]]

[[The Pit]] is located south of river to the West

Bandits looking for people rather than grain
Related to [[Aepoptosis cult]]
