I'm recapping

300 years ago a great calamity, drain of magic
Gods/deities merged into more fundamental concepts
Creating the current pillars
Light and dim aspects of each ideal

Cultists may be worshiping an aspect of protector or lifegiver

Cult is dangerous, misinterpretation of what the god should be negatively impacts the church

Should we learn about the cult's motivations, an act of healing is being prepared
Not as mysterious as it seems

Told them about Kana as a potential Champion of violence

Grove he's from is in the far north
Need to be taken to a warehouse with a big fish 

Odd dice

Rod of being able to see

Discouloured city wall

Purplsish sky
rather than monochrome

Torch is casting shadows but not light

Stop at a wall with a symbol on it

Diamond shape, with 8 or 10 lines
[[Gigr]] says grove taken by OMBAK

Humanoid figure with sunken face
Three large spider legs emerging from the face

OMBAK
Cosmic being lives between worlds, eats planets

City grove is a reflection realm
