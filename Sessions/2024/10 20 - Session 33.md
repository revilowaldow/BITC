[[Thodunn]] received a delivery of coals

> Meet me behind the company headquarters - P

[[Piggy]]

Where is the purple powder cave?
Craghold

[[Sea Blooded Organisation]] want the purple powder

Thodunn is a spy

Asking Jokku when the expedition is going

Stealth is finding the cave
Then party will be sent

<hr>

Aru and Utu visiting the Crimson Keep

Utu started in the Gold Comanda

[[Gyak Thun]] was Utu's mentor

Utu saw a Wendigo comanda along the wabar once

Suddenly injured, for no reason

Rescued by crimson keep

Asleep for 3 days

Wound matches vrin's old scar

[[Shree Aton]] - stinger of scorpion comanda

<hr>


[[Marcah]] - purveyor of games

Bought knucklebones


<hr>

Thodunn wisdom save

Sounds of whirring and clicking in head
Wheels, wool, getting job done
Gold Clinking

Manufacture > Transport > Sale

Thodunn's arm has scales, but golden hairs poking out between

<hr>

[[Angelical Snowsand]] is at the platinum pot

Ask about the shrike
Woke her up early

As far north as northern kingdom, as far south as here
Shrieks and wails

Likely not unique

Only been heard about for 100 years,, nothing earlier

Noises, livestock and animals going missing
