[[Thodunn]] received a delivery of coals

> Meet me behind the company headquarters - P

[[Piggy]]

Where is the purple powder cave?
Craghold

[[Sea Blooded Organisation]] want the purple powder

Thodunn is a spy

Asking Jokku when the expedition is going

Stealth is finding the cave
Then party will be sent

Working on silver rings (30gp)

Had dreams of golden wires/transport and constructions

Sounds of whirring and clicking in head
Wheels, wool, getting job done
Gold Clinking

Manufacture > Transport > Sale

Thodunn's arm has scales, but golden hairs poking out between

<hr>

Aru and Utu visiting the Crimson Keep

Utu started in the Gold Comanda

[[Gyak Thun]] was Utu's mentor

Utu saw a Wendigo comanda along the wabar once

Suddenly injured, for no reason

Rescued by crimson keep

Asleep for 3 days

Wound matches vrin's old scar

[[Shree Aton]] - stinger of scorpion comanda

String up the smugglers

Phlanx - [[Obsidian Comanda]]

[[Hreato]] - Gold comanda
[[Yrite Vett]] - Older Human, Knew [[Burahaburan]] 

Vanished, found his body a week later
Ripped apart, like paper

Used to hang out with others
[[Poliatar]] - Retired, city of 7000 stairs, kelpwatch
[[Maya]] - Left comanada shortly after
[[Shiv]] - only heard in passing

<hr>


[[Marcah]] - purveyor of games

Bought mammoth knucklebones

<hr>

[[Angelica Snowsand]] is at the platinum pot

Ask about the shrike
Woke her up early

As far north as northern kingdom, as far south as here
Shrieks and wails

Likely not unique

Only been heard about for 100 years,, nothing earlier

Noises, livestock and animals going missing

Sketches produced in unnamed fishing village in helviti wastes near coast
Show large birds, large claws, large beak, bright eyes
West of city of 7000 stairs

Don't trust what you hear, imitates things
Hunts for sport

Can understand and doesn't talk intentionally

[[Wailer]] /[[Shreiker]]? Needs a name

Interested in [[Her Majesty]] and [[Jay Connar]]

[[Flambard Hawk]] is in the room opposite [[Angelica Snowsand]]

Flambard failed to hunt it once near waterhold in the helviti wastes
About a month too late

![[Pasted image 20241020194002.png]]

Migratory?

They like forests, old nest in a cave?

Have a system

Friends 

"If ever you head out there, come see me"

High dignitary of Aegan empire protected by cat from a large seagull

[[Muurak Drass]] - wendigo comanda at Sour Grapes

Wendigo has never successfully hunted one despite taking contracts
Other expeditions did not go well
Need multiple people to hunt them successfully

Fast strikes well, ambush

Need cohesion

As cheap as 40gp, could go as high as 100gp

[[Noky]] - Wendigo's uzgradt

Lurker in the water
Loathing in the water
At night the water hates people
