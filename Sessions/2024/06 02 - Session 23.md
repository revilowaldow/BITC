[[Levvy]] 

Finishing up in fields
heard barking
Bandits appeared with massive and small dogs
Can't run, dogs too fast
Two dozen bandits plus 
Lots of dogs
People with them with strange knives and markings on skin
Hid, covered with sheep shit

Marked ones did strange chant
Five cultists
Forced villagers to fight each other
Took sister, made kill parents

Ink tattoos
Faces and arms

Chanting is infectious 
Mentally suppressed

Cultists mostly men, maybe one woman
Half Orc
Dark loose robes

Attack started at nightfall

Look for sister, 5 years younger shorter, dark hair [[Rev]]

Told Utu to keep a pebble on her

Kana

I was a baby when they burned it

Lachaka was burned on order of Kathkach
Burned by the helviti
thought there was a disease
Thought a rebellious element
Investigation found no evidence
No weapons

[[Houndak]] Missing Human, 70s, male
Leader of Cobalt Comanda

[[JournalEntry.GbxIvNuSOf6usjAy]]

Houndak took Kana 
Crisis of faith, goign after Kathkach

Went back to Lady Eylaine

Memory of woman screaming for looking like a monster
Kana is now a solider self-described
Has my target
Eylaine still in power, replaced Houndak

Helviti are an invading force for many

Raised as a soilder
Likes the dogs
Like the people who you live with

The Last Daughter of Lachaka

Father found allies who want to see a change in power
