 Arcanists (Parchians??)
	- [[Mholok Krass]]
	- [[Torniar Maluka]] (taught by Mholok)
Humans wearing kapats

Kathkachians
From Parch, but happy to be out from under their yoke
[[Vixel]] - Not accident
Not a personal associate

Third greatest practitioner

Mholok: focusses on alteration of matter
	Interested in knowledge over power
		Developing of spells

Mholok to travel to chineria soon, though Torniar will remain

Vixel was interested in: 
	Astrology
		Keen on topic of communicating with the beyond

Need to talk to [[Shiendo Kadan]] about Vixel

Shiendo says talk to [[Kevin Aldragosh]]

Lachaka burning could be what burned [[Virtelle The Silver Blade]]
Adoptive daughter of [[Lady Fara Eyelaine]]

No fire in the whole party?
Maybe to avoid virtelle being traumatised?
