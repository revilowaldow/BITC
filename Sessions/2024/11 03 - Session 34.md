Stargazing in Matchaka

- Chameleon - disguise self, deception
- Blink Dog - teleport, distance
- Jaculi - stealth + poison
- Girallon - spectral arms melee + action economy, climb speed
- Shackle - restraint, improve to paralysis

Things to look for guidance on
- Ombak
- Shriker
- Dyvarre
- Palantir


Blink dog constellation is faded, power has waned, perhaps a representation of dog prince
Girallon is as strong as normal

Shackle - strong, close and present
Wizard - sage, looms over potently
Lion - claws, going rawr, near moon


Dyvarre - shackle, lion, dragon, others not quite able to grasp
- Constellation of the wizard for others
