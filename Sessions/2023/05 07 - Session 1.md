Lights had been seen on the north side of town recently
[[Teryna]] (armed civilian) went to investigate
[[Yukil]] the goblin blacksmith supposedly saw [[Calamxis]] (the dripping knight) the gladiator passing by on the night of the lights hidden under a scruffy cloak but could tell by his movements
There are three Chimera Comanda in town, two male, one female

The party met a refugee called [[Niko]] who was fleeing Chineria city
He let the party know that the mine had been closed due to scratching noises after 2 tunnels had been opened. Apparently the miners have been having bad dreams

The Coprun [[Market]] is run by an orc named [[Leilis]] who is flamboyantly dressed

The party rested overnight in the tavern with one minorly damaged bed
There was some discussion of backstories;
- [[Amaranth]] and [[Aru]] know each other and seem to have a suspect past involving someone called [[Nefros]]
- [[Kaulinan Badag|Kaulinan]] said he was from the Jungles and revealed his age
- [[Cainus]] revealed the Mule is named [[Eugene]]

The Party investigated the lights first, heading north and finding an earthscar 1 hour outside town
[[Teryna]] had already found a longsword which Kaulinan identified as having Celestial script on it and a heavy level of transmutation magic. The scar itself had an aura of conjuration magic


The current year is 261 of the New Age
