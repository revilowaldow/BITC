There are three Chimera Comanda in town, two male, one female

The party rested overnight in the tavern with one minorly damaged bed
There was some discussion of backstories;
- [[Amaranth]] and [[Aru]] know each other and seem to have a suspect past.
- [[Kaulinan Badag|Kaulinan]] said he was from the Jungles and revealed his age
- [[Cainus]] revealed the Mule is named [[Muriel]]
