### Instructions from Adam:

For Thodunn:
- read runes on chains? 
- ⁠break chains if [[Virtelle]] agrees the risk.
- ⁠do not let [[piggy]] escape
- ⁠[[piggy]] is manacled and asleep
- ⁠I have just reactivated giants might
- ⁠If opportunity, question [[piggy]] about additional Aegan drop off points? Has piggy intercepted my communication to and from the empire? Plus other obvious questions around sea blooded organisation and the cultists.
- ⁠If I kill him I want to convey that he meant nothing to me. I think piggy has a hatred for Thodunn and it will destroy piggy if thinks he wasn’t considered a rival or nemesis
- ⁠I’d quite like to live but I do have a runic shield left to defend someone within 60ft.
- ⁠I might swap to warhammer and shield or mining grinding and shield for the extra AC.
- ⁠lastly my shortswords are called Dead and Alive. Might be something cool there if I kill piggy. 
- ⁠I will also be insight-ing the fuck out of piggy and [[Virtelle]] with advantage
