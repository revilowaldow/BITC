Alex to recap

### Instructions from Adam:

For Thodunn:
- read runes on chains? 
- ⁠break chains if Vert agrees the risk.
- ⁠do not let piggy escape
- ⁠piggy is manacled and asleep
- ⁠I have just reactivated giants might
- ⁠if opportunity, question piggy about additional aegon drop off points? Has piggy intercepted my communication to and from the empire? Plus other obvious questions around sea blooded organisation and the cultists.
- ⁠if I kill him I want to convey that he meant nothing to me. I think piggy has a hatred for Thodunn and it will destroy piggy if thinks he wasn’t  considered a rival or nemesis
- ⁠I’d quite like to live but I do have a runic shield left to defend someone within 60ft.
- ⁠I might swap to warhammer and shield or mining grinding and shield for the extra AC.
- ⁠lastly my shortswords are called dead and alive. Might be something cool there if I kill piggy. 
- ⁠I will also be insighting the fuck out of piggy and Vertelle with advantage
