Used to be able to chat with sister

[[Hera]] - Bheur Hag

Cute you think it's a star
Hole that's pulling in magic

Hag's greystaff - broken
Herbs, seasonings, spices and teeth - buried

[[Aru of the Sands]] resurrecting [[Vrindrilliax]]

[[Kalamsis]] - heard at great distance
> "What on earth are you."
