Leomunds tiny hut

Azure glow turns yellow after 1 minute

> "For ye with wit and wisdom, all that you need, you have taken"

Dungeon of Destiny disappears

Thodunn takes the coins

Tudor buried, drank some vermillion red

Kauliann created a tombstone for Tudor with a statue of a bird

<hr>

Aru heads north

Stopped from contacting [[Shree Aton]]

A lady from Topaz commanda
Two men from gold comanada

Topaz comanda wants information on a status in exchange for information on a statue
Grey, meticulously carved, elf
(Probably the Dyvare statue in the [[Ziardim Caverns]])
(Could also be thodunn? Came from the battle of looming rock and had been petrified)

Looming Rock item

Find the nomads of the helviti wastes

[[Shree Aton]] would probably let you pass

Does the name [[Maya]] ring a bell?


<hr>

Wailer confit

Caenis assembles colleagues from the silver company as a performance of him creating the confit

Larkin ate way too much spicy wailer



<hr>

[[Jay Connar]] appears at door with [[Gigr]]

Invitation, s√©ance 

What entities are going to be affecting the valley?

At night in the gold district

*two days later*

Cats are a sign of bad luck for Helviti

Perhaps lion comanda

Meditation

Dark star associated with dread and dark magic, blood star, growing in strength
Favourable sign for mages of evil intent

Scales, balance and monetary transaction
Constellation of the dragon, powerful entity, separate from mortality

Constellation of the lord, rulership, authority and inheritance
Hover between each side (red star and scales)

Two orbiting constellations
	Lantern star - bright, short appearance, short fires, heat and passion
	Dagger constellation - night time activity, theft, betrayal

Purple star and destiny, not at all lessened

Dark cloud on the horizon, hiding in shadows between stars, a force we can't see

Reflection realm rod probably less important

Helviti inquisition HQ in kathkach to be set up

Silver company apparently investing in Chineria

"Enjoy your new sword"

<hr>

Thodunn finds [[Jokku Troph]] to work on heliotropic bronze

Successfully craft a heliotropic bronze halberd
+1 to damage

Approached by a wounded Aegan commoner
Shot with a crossbow, by a giant monster with a 'ballista of a weapon'

> "Thodunn where the fuck have you been?"

I work for [[General Duty]], in Barbakn

Double agent broke up only a month ago
Your handler went missing

I'm with the Aegan empire, I was told you're also an Agent here

Thodunn kills the person in the alley

[[Thodunn]] tells the party
Aru tells Thodunn that Topaz commanda was looking for status of elf from looming rock


<hr>


Get money from side gig
Money from salary
Paid rent

<hr>

Summoned to Kev's office

Malain trade empire growing in power
This has cut into the Eyelaines' power

They want to make a non-compete trade deal
More trade gets to flow through Kathkach

[[Candaria Malain]] is not heading up the negotiations
Instead her daughter will be [[Palara Malain]]

Same for [[Lady Fara Eyelaine]] being subbed out for [[Virtelle]]

[[Virtelle]] has been missing for 2 days

The silver company is going to do additional trade with Chineria

Kev used to be a squire for [[Lady Fara Eyelaine]], perhaps infatuated at the time
Not made a move on her though

Meeting needs to happen within next two weeks 
We don't need to be present at meeting

Gala will happen this evening
Attendees:
- [[Palara Malain]]
- [[Virtelle]]
- [[Kev]]

Slender straight longsword, engraved with ancient runes

Cold to the touch
Magical, no
