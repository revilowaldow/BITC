A lady from Topaz commanda
Two men from gold comanada

Meditation

Dark star associated with dread and dark magic, blood star, growing in strength
Favourable sign for mages of evil intent

Scales, balance and monetary transaction
Constellation of the dragon, powerful entity, separate from mortality

Constellation of the lord, rulership, authority and inheritance
Hover between each side (red star and scales)

Two orbiting constellations
	Lantern star - bright, short appearance, short fires, heat and passion
	Dagger constellation - night time activity, theft, betrayal

Purple star and destiny, not at all lessened

Dark cloud on the horizon, hiding in shadows between stars, a force we can't see

Reflection realm rod probably less important
