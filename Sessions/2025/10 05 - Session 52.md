Aru heads north

Stopped from contacting [[Shree Aton]]

A lady from Topaz commanda
Two men from gold comanada

Topaz comanda wants information on a status in exchange for information on a statue
Grey, meticulously carved, elf
(Probably the Dyvare statue in the [[Ziardim Caverns]])
(Could also be thodunn? Came from the battle of looming rock and had been petrified)

Looming Rock item

Find the nomads of the helviti wastes

[[Shree Aton]] would probably let you pass

Does the name [[Maya]] ring a bell?

Shot with a crossbow, by a giant monster with a 'ballista of a weapon'

> "Thodunn where the fuck have you been?"

I work for [[General Duty]], in Barbakn

Your handler went missing

I'm with the Aegan empire, I was told you're also an Agent here
