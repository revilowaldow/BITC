Still in ![[Ziardim Caverns.canvas]]
Three figures

- 2 Freedom City Ninjas - "Agents of Freedom City"

Purple Star effect engages again

> "I will be the destined one" - Manticar Viole

Val remembers being on an altar

Remove chest plates to touch golden threads inside val

Tall spires with rounded tops, clinking of chain mail, sounds of water, light tunics, tired, can't go to sleep

[[Conrad]] - Hoping Manticar Viole would be soldier against the chinerians
Hoping for the dyvare, slave of chineria

Whilspar - Flail

Made in Eastern City States during war between Yaoi and Chineria 75 years ago, wielded by [[Jiu-Len Whilspar]]
Gifted by arcanists
Jiu-Len fell in battle and the weapon claimed the warriors name
Sentient weapon, attunement, alignment - likes killers
Attacks feel much easier
Makes its own attacks
Cold damage
Dark reputation
Can't give it up after wielding it
Attune via overnight discussion with the weapon
