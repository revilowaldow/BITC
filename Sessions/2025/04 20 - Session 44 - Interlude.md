This session is a one shot where Oliver is covering for Richard.

## The Secret Ingredient

*Head Chef Master* [[Palanda Macav]] is holding trials for his immediate followers within [[The Cooking Association]] to identify his new *Sous Chef de Cuisine*; a prestigious deputy role tipped as a potential successor to the guild master.

But trouble is brewing, opportunists seek to sabotage their competitors, and worse yet, the mark of station that is to be bestowed; the *Aether Pepper*, has been stolen.

The Silver Company find their downtime urgently interrupted, with no time to recall [[Kaulinan Badag]] from his stargazing, [[Kevin Aldragosh]] directs the other party members to report to [[Palanda Macav]] immediately.

[[Palanda Macav]] tasks the party to investigate the vault from which the *Aether Pepper* was stolen, to return it before the conclusion of the trials, and to identify the culprit. The loss of the pepper must be kept secret so as not to disrupt the trials, which makes questioning the participants, the prime suspects, nigh impossible. The party is also expected to report on the infighting between the participants though not necessarily intervene; after all, a chef must have other talents beyond simple cookery.

Should the party succeed they will be handsomely rewarded, though the Head Chef has something special to offer for the young *Saucier* in the party.

###  _A Summons to the Kitchen_

**The party arrives** at [[The Cooking Association]]'s grand hall just before dawn, a squat campus of packed earth and polished stone, kitchens, gardens, and vaults. [[Palanda Macav]] meets them privately in his smoke-swirled office.

- He informs them the **Aether Pepper** is missing from the **Vault of Infusions**.
- The **trials are already underway**, and the participants cannot know of the theft—maintaining morale and the legitimacy of the process is paramount.
- They are authorized to **investigate, interview (carefully), and report** any misconduct.
- The trials are to conclude that evening after each meal of the day has been served—a strict deadline.

> "A pepper can elevate, or it can spoil a promising dish. Return the *Aether Pepper* before the feast bell, and you’ll have earned more than my gratitude."

### _The Vault & The Clues_

**The Vault of Infusions** shows no signs of brute force entry. Magical security is intact. But:

- **Arcana Check**: Someone used **minor planar manipulation magic** to phase through briefly.
- **Investigation**: A stray speck of a strange, iridescent flour—common in **Chef Ezzar's "Cloud Bread" technique**.
- **Footprints**: Traces of spice dust lead through a **service corridor**, connecting to the contestants’ lounge and kitchens.

The party discover the **contestants’ personal ingredients** are stored in sealed lockers—one locker is tampered with.

From here, the party can explore the building to gather more clues:
- **The Experimental Kitchens**
- **The Tea Garden (a place of quiet meditation)**
- **The Fermentation Cellar**
- **Observation Gallery**, where VIPs and sponsors watch

### _Interviewing the Chefs_

Each contestant is a powerful personality—volatile, secretive, or ruthless. They each:
- Have something to hide (even if not the theft)
- Are under pressure
- May try to **manipulate the party**

1. **Ezzar Brinn** – Cloud-cooking wizard. Eccentric, forgetful, aloof. (Dust clue)
2. **Sousette Vorn** – Sharp, political, and cunning. Possibly orchestrating sabotage… 
3. **Brogg Mauldine** – Orc butcher, surprisingly gentle. Hates liars and is oddly philosophical.
4. **Mirl Saffra** – Spicesmith bard who’s been missing a vial of dreamroot (a mild hallucinogen).
5. **Fayne Lurrek** – Alchemical cook, obsessed with culinary purity. Found burned notes in her locker.

### _The Cellar Showdown_

The party tracks the pepper to the **Fermentation Cellar**—a damp, mystical chamber where flavour is aged in a great number of experimental vats, some long forgotten.

They find the thief: **Sousette Vorn**, working with an outsider—a spice-spirited homunculus—trying to **infuse herself** with the Aether Pepper to create a dish only she can make.

**Combat Setup**:

- **Sousette**, who uses culinary magic in battle—scalding soufflés, binding noodle whips, flavor-based enchantments.
- **The Homunculus**, a spice-elemental creature with area-of-effect "aroma bursts" and spice-based conditions (blind, cough, hallucinate).
- Environmental hazards: tipping barrels, volatile fermentation gas, boiling vats.
