This session is a one shot where Oliver is covering for Richard.

## The Secret Ingredient

*Head Chef Master* [[Palanda Macav]] is holding trials for his immediate followers within [[The Cooking Association]] to identify his new *Sous Chef de Cuisine*; a prestigious deputy role tipped as a potential successor to the guild master.

But trouble is brewing, opportunists seek to sabotage their competitors, and worse yet, the mark of station that is to be bestowed; the *Aether Pepper*, has been stolen.

The Silver Company find their downtime urgently interrupted, with no time to recall [[Kaulinan Badag]] from his stargazing, [[Kevin Aldragosh]] directs the other party members to report to [[Palanda Macav]] immediately.

[[Palanda Macav]] tasks the party to investigate the vault from which the *Aether Pepper* was stolen, to return it before the conclusion of the trials, and to identify the culprit. The loss of the pepper must be kept secret so as not to disrupt the trials, which makes questioning the participants, the prime suspects, nigh impossible. The party is also expected to report on the infighting between the participants though not necessarily intervene; after all, a chef must have other talents beyond simple cookery.

Should the party succeed they will be handsomely rewarded, though the Head Chef has something special to offer for the young *Saucier* in the party.

### ### Scene 1: _A Summons to the Kitchen_

**The party arrives** at [[The Cooking Association]]'s grand hall in late evening, a squat campus of packed earth and polished stone, kitchens, gardens, and vaults. [[Palanda Macav]] meets them privately in his smoke-swirled office.

- He informs them the **Aether Pepper** is missing from the **Vault of Infusions**.
- The **trials are already underway**, and the participants cannot know of the theft—maintaining morale and the legitimacy of the process is paramount.
- They are authorized to **investigate, interview (carefully), and report** any misconduct.
- The trials conclude  **four hours**—a strict deadline.

> "A pepper can burn, or it can elevate. Let's see which way this mystery will go. Return the Aether Pepper before the feast bell, and you’ll have earned more than my gratitude."
