> Kaulinan is approaching the end of his life and is much less interested in new young up and coming people, or short lived individuals than his contemporaries. He would be far more interested in someone who like him has seen the rise and fall of civilisation. He's also very interested in magic, but in a more active sense. To Kaulinan an individual with magic shouldn't just be someone who is magically imbued e.g. a 40 year old dyvare, but someone who really immersed themselves in active control of it and worked towards a respect of it. He's also very principled and would want to see that in others. Magic isn't something to be controlled or abused, he views it more as a fundamental natural state and shaping its flow for worthwhile beliefs or tenets far outstrips a short term view an individual or organisation might hold of it's immediate utility. An individual would be: - An active magic user - Sincere - A good or neutral alignment - Hold themselves and others to a strong set of principles - Old enough to need to be a longer lived race or someone right at the end of their life - Not apathetic, but they certainly would have little concern for the day to day or week to week squabbles of factions A lot of these are traits Kaulinan himself embodies, but that's intentional, after 300 years he's reflected deeply on who he wants to be. Current group or convenience aside, he has no close friends from his long life and has seen prior groups come and go. He's very at peace with who he's been and he knows his days are closing. For someone to catch his interest they'd have to have lived a life with strong similarities to his own, (though not necessarily need to be a druid). There is also, at the back of his mind, a slight regret and the idea of procreation if he still has time, but I think he'd also be content with a more spiritual or magical legacy. His grove dying is a threat to that legacy and may be the source of his regret.
