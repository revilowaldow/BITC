This session is a one shot where Oliver is covering for Richard.

## The Secret Ingredient

*Head Chef Master* [[Palanda Macav]] is holding trials for his immediate followers within [[The Cooking Association]] to identify his new *Sous Chef de Cuisine*; a prestigious deputy role tipped as a potential successor to the guild master.

But trouble is brewing, opportunists seek to sabotage their competitors, and worse yet, the mark of station that is to be bestowed; the *Aether Pepper*, has been stolen.

The Silver Company find their downtime urgently interrupted, with no time to recall [[Kaulinan Badag]] from his stargazing, [[Kevin Aldragosh]] directs the other party members to report to [[Palanda Macav]] immediately.

[[Palanda Macav]] tasks the party to investigate the vault from which the *Aether Pepper* was stolen, to return it before the conclusion of the trials, and to identify the culprit. The loss of the pepper must be kept secret so as not to disrupt the trials, which makes questioning the participants, the prime suspects, nigh impossible. The party is also expected to report on the infighting between the participants though not necessarily intervene; after all, a chef must have other talents beyond simple cookery.

Should the party succeed they will be handsomely rewarded, though the Head Chef has something special to offer for the young *Saucier* in the party.

[[Candaria Malain]] has attempted to *curry flavour* with the cooking guild and [[Palanda Macav]] through trade and supply routes recently. She coerced and bribed [[Sousette Vorn]] to steal the pepper with her Enforcers meeting up with her in one of the vaults that joins to the ancient Kathkachan tunnels.

###  _A Summons to the Kitchen_

The party, having been woken by [[Larkin]], and addressed by [[Kevin Aldragosh]], arrives at [[The Cooking Association]]'s grand hall just before dawn, a squat campus of packed earth and polished stone, kitchens, gardens, and vaults. [[Palanda Macav]] meets them privately in his smoke-swirled office.

- He informs them the **Aether Pepper** is missing from the **Vault of Infusions**.
- The **trials are already underway**, and the participants cannot know of the theft. Maintaining morale and the legitimacy of the process is paramount.
- They are authorized to **investigate, interview (carefully), and report** any misconduct.
- The trials are to conclude that evening after each meal of the day has been served.

> "A pepper can elevate, or it can spoil a promising dish. Return the *Aether Pepper* before the feast bell, and you’ll have earned more than my gratitude."

### _The Vault & The Clues_

**The Vault of Infusions** shows no signs of brute force entry. Security is intact with a constant guard from the Helviti who records all individuals who accessed the vault. But:

- **Arcana Check**: A small vial has been abandoned near the vault, it contains a tiny amount of invisibility potion, someone has snuck into the vault.
- **Investigation**: A stray speck of a strange, iridescent flour—common in **Chef Ezzar's "Cloud Bread" technique**.
- **Footprints**: Traces of spice dust lead through a service corridor, connecting to the contestants’ lounge and kitchens.

The party discover the **contestants’ personal ingredients** are stored in sealed lockers—one locker is tampered with.

From here, the party can explore the building to gather more clues:
- **The Experimental Kitchens**
- [[The Tea Garden]] (a place of quiet meditation)
- ~~**The Fermentation Cellar**~~ (this is where [[Sousette Vorn]] will meet the enforcers)
- **Observation Gallery**, where VIPs and sponsors watch
- [[Mise En Place]]
- [[The Brine Vaults]]
- [[The Proving Grounds]]
- [[The Seasonarium]]
- [[The Smoked Hall]]
- [[The Bloodmarble Butchery]]

### _Interviewing the Chefs_

Each contestant is a powerful personality—volatile, secretive, or ruthless. They each:
- Have something to hide (even if not the theft)
- Are under pressure
- May try to **manipulate the party**

1. **Ezzar Brinn** – Cloud-cooking baker. Eccentric, forgetful, aloof. (Dust clue, but suppliers)
2. [[Sousette Vorn]] – Sharp, political, and cunning goblin. The culprit, but being coerced by [[Candaria Malain]].
3. **Brogg Mauldine** – Orc butcher, surprisingly gentle. Hates liars and is oddly philosophical.
4. **Mirl Saffra** – Spicesmith who’s been missing a vial of dreamroot (a mild hallucinogen).
5. **Fayne Lurrek** – Alchemical sommelier, obsessed with culinary purity. Found burned notes in her locker.

### _The Cellar Showdown / “Spoiled Ambitions”_

Following the trail of clues—the party is led to the **Fermentation Cellar**, a shadowy, cavernous under-croft of ancient barrels, glass tubes, and pungent arcane vapours.

There, they find [[Sousette Vorn]], not alone, but flanked by **agents of [[Candaria Malain]]—a powerful merchant leader that supplies rare ingredients, controls several food markets, and has long desired more influence in the Cooking Association. 

> Souzette wants to become the new Sous Chef and broker an exclusive supply contract that would grant the Malain faction inside control over the guild’s procurement and distribution chains.
#### Combat
- Sousette: Goblin Hexer 2025 MM
- Two Bugbear Lieutenants TftYP (reflavour race) - [[Malain Enforcer]]
- Poison Weird (WDMM) from disturbed barrel/thrown potion - could do two if side-agnostic
#### Environment Hazards:
- **Fermentation fumes**: Fire or sparks may cause minor explosions.
- **Slippery walkways**: Dexterity saves to avoid spills or be knocked into brewing vats.
- **Reactive mushrooms**: If damaged, release confusion-inducing spores (Con saves or hallucinations).

<hr>

### _The Trials End_

Whether or not they recover the Aether Pepper intact, the party returns to [[Palanda Macav]] as the trials conclude.

- **If successful**, the pepper is added to the final ceremony, Sousette does not compete.
- **If they fail**, the trials are marred, and Macav may blame them damaging relations between the guild and the silver company or turn the fallout into a lesson on adaptability.
