Lachakan Note (Town Hall Offices)

_...Morzak believes the rebellious elements in the city may in fact have been hiding here to escape Kathkach; if this is the case, it should be made clear to the ruling elite there that it is not Lachaka that aims to rise up against them, rather it is their own rebels that are the problem._
_Regarding the disease that spreads through the city, I believe it to be controllable; we have summoned medicine men from Barbakn, as the missives sent to Kathkach do not seem to be reaching them. I only hope that the situation calms down before they do something we will regret._

_Signed, Mayor Jukar Mol_
