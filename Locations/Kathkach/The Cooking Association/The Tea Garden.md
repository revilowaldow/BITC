A tranquil inner sanctum tucked behind a curtain of flowering vines and misty bamboo screens. The **Tea Garden** is a place of reflection, ritual, and refined palate development. Designed in harmony with elemental magic, it is tended by quiet practitioners known as the **Steepers**—chefs who specialize in infusions, clarity, and balance of spirit.

**Key Features**:
- **Meditation Pools**: Still water basins surrounded by smooth stones, perfect for taste-clarity rituals.
- **Fragrant Canopies**: Overhead trellises of steam-blooming herbs like lotus mint, whisper-leaf, and saffron poppy.
- **Stone Teahouse**: Where the Tea Masters hold silent tastings—only gestures, nods, and the sound of pouring tea are allowed.
- **Sand Garden of Flavors**: A raked arena where chefs interpret emotional states with blends of tea and spice.
- **Brew Stones**: Heated slabs used for dry-leaf alchemy and extraction experimentation.

**Roleplay/Exploration Hooks**:
- A rival quietly poisons the tasting pot of a competitor—will anyone detect the subtle shift?
- A master is searching for the perfect leaf to brew “a tea that silences regret.”
- An ancient teapot has started whispering forgotten recipes in an unknown dialect.
