A locked, pristine chamber only accessible to guildmasters and senior sous chefs, where legendary mise en place is kept ready for moments of utmost importance. A holy site of perfect preparation.

**Hooks**:
- A spoon is missing. Not just any spoonâ€”the First Spoon.
- A ghostly chef whispers mise en guidance to those who enter alone.
