**Overview**:  
Tucked behind iron-scented stone doors, the **Bloodmarble Butchery** is where raw ingredients meet blade, bone, and precision. Named for the veined red-and-white stone used to tile its floors—stained forever despite decades of scrubbing—this chamber is a sanctum for those who believe that **butchery is as much an art as plating**.

Loud, visceral, and strangely ritualistic, this space is governed by the **Fleshwrights**, elite cleaver-wielders whose anatomical knowledge rivals that of any surgeon. They speak in cuts, cleaves, and carving patterns more than words.
