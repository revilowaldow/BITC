**Overview**:  
Tucked behind iron-scented stone doors, the **Bloodmarble Butchery** is where raw ingredients meet blade, bone, and precision. Named for the veined red-and-white stone used to tile its floors—stained forever despite decades of scrubbing—this chamber is a sanctum for those who believe that **butchery is as much an art as plating**.

Loud, visceral, and strangely ritualistic, this space is governed by the **Fleshwrights**, elite cleaver-wielders whose anatomical knowledge rivals that of any surgeon. They speak in cuts, cleaves, and carving patterns more than words.

- **Cleaver's Ring**  
    A central, circular butchering platform where training and duels take place. Enchanted drains pull away blood instantly, and runes keep the temperature just above freezing to preserve meat without magic.
- **Cold Vaults**  
    Rows of enchanted lockers and hanging rails storing fresh and exotic carcasses—ranging from wyverns to giant fire-snails. Suspiciously locked crates suggest someone’s hoarding choice cuts.
- **Gristle Archives**  
    Bone charts, tendon diagrams, and ancestral carving techniques line the walls. Here, apprentices learn to separate meat from magic—some monsters require _very_ specific methods of separation to remain safe.
- **The Flensing Hall**  
    An ancient tiled annex where cursed meats or magically tainted remains are carefully dissected. Access is tightly controlled. A single wrong cut could release lingering enchantments or plagues.
- **Render Pit**  
    A sealed sub-chamber where offal, bones, and scraps are rendered down for stock, glue, oils—or more esoteric purposes. Alchemists often collaborate here under risky conditions.
