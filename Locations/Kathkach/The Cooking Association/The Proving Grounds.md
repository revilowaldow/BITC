- Speaks in military metaphors: “Flank your foe with acid. Deliver the coup de grâce with umami.”

1. **“You bring weak seasoning into _my_ ring? That’s like slapping a basil leaf on a boar and calling it ham.”**
2. **“This ain’t a salad bar, chef—this is war. And your vinaigrette just deserted you.”**
3. **“He sautéed with fear. I could smell it—like burnt onions and cowardice.”**
4. **“Your knife cuts soft, like butter on a summer windowsill. You trying to fillet or flirt?”**
5. **“In my kitchen, you either bring the heat or get flambéed.”**
6. **“You don’t _plate_ shameful food like that. You bury it under a shallow herb crust and lie to the judges.”**
7. **“Tried to bribe me with truffle oil. I told him to marinate in his own disgrace.”**
8. **“They say revenge is a dish best served cold. I say, if it ain’t charred at the edges, you didn’t sear the point in.”**
9. **“Your soufflé collapsed faster than my second marriage. And that had a lawyer and three witnesses.”**
10. **“You cook like a wizard with amnesia—loud, flashy, and with no idea what you're doing.”**
11. **“Ah, the flambé. The last resort of the desperate and the pyromaniac.”**
12. **“He stirred clockwise in the northern hemisphere. Rookie mistake. Flavor swirls _against_ the spin.”**
13. **“Flavor profile? More like flavor _missing person report_.”**
14. **“You call that a reduction? I’ve cried harder during onion prep.”**
15. **“That roast had potential… and you murdered it. Cold blood. In front of an audience. Bravo.”**
