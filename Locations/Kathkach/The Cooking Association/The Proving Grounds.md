**Title**: Warden of the Flame, Duelmaster of the Pan  
**Race**: Half-Orc  
**Age**: 42  
**Pronouns**: He/Him  
**Appearance**:

- A cast-iron skillet hangs at his belt like a warhammer, and he always carries a **scarred tasting ladle** tucked into a shoulder holster
- Wears a tall, creased chef's hat with medals pinned into it like a general’s helm
- Speaks in military metaphors: “Flank your foe with acid. Deliver the coup de grâce with umami.”

- **“You bring weak seasoning into _my_ ring? That’s like slapping a basil leaf on a boar and calling it ham.”**
- **“This ain’t a salad bar, chef—this is war. And your vinaigrette just deserted you.”**
- **“He sautéed with fear. I could smell it—like burnt onions and cowardice.”**
- **“Your knife cuts soft, like butter on a summer windowsill. You trying to fillet or flirt?”**
- **“In my kitchen, you either bring the heat or get flambéed.”**
- **“You don’t _plate_ shameful food like that. You bury it under a shallow herb crust and lie to the judges.”**
- **“Tried to bribe me with truffle oil. I told him to marinate in his own disgrace.”**
- **“They say revenge is a dish best served cold. I say, if it ain’t charred at the edges, you didn’t sear the point in.”**
- **“Your soufflé collapsed faster than my second marriage. And that had a lawyer and three witnesses.”**
- **“You cook like a wizard with amnesia—loud, flashy, and with no idea what you're doing.”**
- **“Ah, the flambé. The last resort of the desperate and the pyromaniac.”**
- **“He stirred clockwise in the northern hemisphere. Rookie mistake. Flavor swirls _against_ the spin.”**
- **“Flavor profile? More like flavor _missing person report_.”**
- **“You call that a reduction? I’ve cried harder during onion prep.”**
- **“That roast had potential… and you murdered it. Cold blood. In front of an audience. Bravo.”**
