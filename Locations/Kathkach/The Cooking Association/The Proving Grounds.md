An open-air plaza and baking arena where breadmakers duel with sourdough starters and precision-timed rising techniques. Magic is frowned upon—only heat, timing, and doughcraft matter here. The crowd chants “Rye or Die!”

Hopefuls who want to enter the guild are put through their basic training paces here.

**Hooks**:
- A sabotaged oven has caused a yeast golem outbreak.

## 🛡️ NPC: Gourmand-Provost Brannick Vex

**Title**: Warden of the Flame, Duelmaster of the Pan  
**Race**: Half-Orc  
**Age**: 42  
**Pronouns**: He/Him  
**Appearance**:

- Half chef whites and half duelling armour
- A cast-iron skillet hangs at his belt like a warhammer, and he always carries a **scarred tasting ladle** tucked into a shoulder holster
- Wears a tall, creased chef's hat with medals pinned into it like a general’s helm
- Speaks in military metaphors: 
- 
1. “Flank your foe with acid. Deliver the coup de grâce with umami.”
2. **“You bring weak seasoning into _my_ ring? That’s like slapping a basil leaf on a boar and calling it ham.”**
3. **“This ain’t a salad bar, chef—this is war. And your vinaigrette just deserted you.”**
4. **“He sautéed with fear. I could smell it—like burnt onions and cowardice.”**
5. **“Your knife cuts soft, like butter on a summer windowsill. You trying to fillet or flirt?”**
6. **“In my kitchen, you either bring the heat or get flambéed.”**
7. **“Your soufflé collapsed faster than my second marriage. And that had a lawyer and three witnesses.”**
8. **“You cook like a wizard with amnesia—loud, flashy, and with no idea what you're doing.”**
9. **“Ah, the flambé. The last resort of the desperate and the pyromaniac.”**
10. **“He stirred clockwise in the northern hemisphere. Rookie mistake. Flavor swirls _against_ the spin.”**
11. **“You call that a brine? I’ve cried saltier tears during onion prep.”**
12. **“That roast had potential… and you murdered it. Cold blood. In front of an audience. Bravo.”**
