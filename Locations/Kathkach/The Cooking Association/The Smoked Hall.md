A vast, soot-stained chamber lined with ancient stone smokers and slow-roasting pits. Aromas of woodsmoke and char cling to everything. The hall is overseen by the Smokewarden, a reclusive master of preservation and meat alchemy. A favourite haunt of traditionalists and carnivores.

Hooks:
- A prized smoked basilisk haunch has gone missing.
- Strange burn marks suggest unauthorized late-night experiments.
