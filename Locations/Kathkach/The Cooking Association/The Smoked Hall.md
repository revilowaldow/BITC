A vast, soot-stained chamber lined with ancient stone smokers and slow-roasting pits. Aromas of woodsmoke and char cling to everything. The hall is overseen by the Smokewarden, a reclusive master of preservation and meat alchemy. A favourite haunt of traditionalists and carnivores.

Hooks:
- A prized smoked basilisk haunch has gone missing.
- Strange burn marks suggest unauthorized late-night experiments.

## 🔥 NPC: Smokewarden Tuhar-Zin

**Title**: Keeper of Flame & Ash, Smokewarden of the Guild  
**Race**: Dwarf  
**Age**: Late 60s  
**Pronouns**: He/Him  
**Appearance**:

- Wiry frame; wrapped in layered robes the colour of coal and ember
- Wrinkled skin with smoke filling every pore
- Hands permanently stained with soot, gold rings charred black from decades of use
- Beard bound in wire mesh to prevent it catching fire; it smells faintly of cedar smoke
- Distrusts other types of cooking: “If the flame doesn’t kiss it, it isn’t food.”
- Oversees all smoked and slow-prepared goods—jerky, smoked cheeses, long-roast beasts
- **Quirk**: Refuses to speak to anyone who doesn’t smell at least _a little_ of smoke. Carries around a smoking pouch and will light a clove sprig and waft it at newcomers to "fix them."
- Voice like a chain smoker- unsurprisingly

Basil
