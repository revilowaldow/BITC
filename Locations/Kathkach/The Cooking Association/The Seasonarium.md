A lush greenhouse where herbs, spices, and exotic plants are grown in magically accelerated conditions. The air is thick with floral scent and arcane humidity. Run by druids-turned-herbalists who consider seasoning a sacred rite.

**Hooks**:
- A rogue spice vine has overgrown into other departments.
- A rare bloom needed for the final trial is about to flowerâ€”and everyone wants it.

Four chambers arranged like petals on a central courtyard:
- **Spring Ward**: Bursting with florals, herbs, and shoots. Bees hum lazily between blossom vines.    
- **Summer Ward**: Dense with heat-loving fruits, melons, and peppers. Light is harsh, golden.
- **Autumn Ward**: Earthy and umami-rich. Mushrooms and root vegetables sprout from loam beds.
- **Winter Ward**: Crisp, preserved flora. Icy brine tanks grow frost-fermented cabbages and bitter roots.
