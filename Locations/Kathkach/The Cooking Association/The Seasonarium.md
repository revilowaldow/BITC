A lush greenhouse where herbs, spices, and exotic plants are grown in magically accelerated conditions. The air is thick with floral scent and arcane humidity. Run by druids-turned-herbalists who consider seasoning a sacred rite.

**Hooks**:
- A rogue spice vine has overgrown into other departments.
- A rare bloom needed for the final trial is about to flower—and everyone wants it.

Four chambers arranged like petals on a central courtyard:
- **Spring Ward**: Bursting with florals, herbs, and shoots. Bees hum lazily between blossom vines.    
- **Summer Ward**: Dense with heat-loving fruits, melons, and peppers. Light is harsh, golden.
- **Autumn Ward**: Earthy and umami-rich. Mushrooms and root vegetables sprout from loam beds.
- **Winter Ward**: Crisp, preserved flora. Icy brine tanks grow frost-fermented cabbages and bitter roots.

The **Seasonarium** is an awe-inspiring, domed greenhouse-laboratory hybrid located in the heart of the Cooking Guild. Half terrarium, half flavour conservatory, it houses rare seasonal ingredients from across the realms—**in controlled ecosystems** tuned to recreate the exact conditions under which they thrive.

A walk through the Seasonarium feels like crossing continents in a single breath: winter-frosted basil from northern peaks shimmers beside sun-warmed thyme from volcanic southern slopes. The air shifts subtly from zone to zone—hot and spicy, damp and sour, crisp and citrusy.

## 🧊 **Bregga Coldstring**, _Guild Hielero_

**“Cool heads make sharper broths.”**

Bregga is the **Hielero** (ice-master) of the Cooking Guild—responsible for the magical and mundane preservation of ingredients through cold. A master of temperature magic, she oversees the frost chambers, larders, iced drink stations, and helps with rapid-chill preparation techniques essential for delicate desserts, seafood, and fermentation control.

She views cold not as absence, but as control—**a sculptor’s chisel** in the grand kitchen.
