Deep underground, this chilly complex of salt rooms, pickling chambers, and magical brine tanks is used to preserve rare aquatic and fungal ingredients. Enchanted brine is rumoured to have rejuvenating properties… or darker side effects.

**Hooks**:
- A preserved kraken eye has become sentient.
- Someone is smuggling potion-grade brine for off-book sales.
