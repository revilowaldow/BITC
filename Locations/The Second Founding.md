Kathkach was founded twice; once by [Brasshand](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,8,brasshand%20the%20bold,0) before the calamity, and once again by the [Dyvare](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,8,the%20dyvare,0). The [Dyvare](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,8,the%20dyvare,0) fought to clear the valley of monsters and invaders with a legendary fighting force called the One-Hundred Dyvarran Golden Guard. After securing the valley, it is presumed that she and the One-Hundred perished in battle before the situation on the Pevic Continent stabilised.

Kathkacha as a region has no standing military. The villages and lower city is patrolled by a local militia, but it is defended from invasion by two of the most well-reputed Helviti Comanda in the world; the [Cobalt Comanda](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,4,cobalt%20comanda,0) and the [Chimera Comanda](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,4,chimera%20comanda,0). [Cobalt Comanda](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,4,cobalt%20comanda,0) defends the [Brass Palace](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,5,the%20brass%20palace,0) and maintains order under the rule of the merchant class and [Chimera Comanda](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,4,chimera%20comanda,0) operates in the wider valley, stamping out lawlessness and banditry. In case that wasn't enough, a third Comanda can be found in the [Crimson Keep](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,4,scorpion%20comanda,0) that guards the pass into the [Helviti Wastes](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,1,the%20helviti%20wastes,0): the vicious [Scorpion Comanda](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,4,scorpion%20comanda,0), reputed to be the most dangerous of all. The [Scorpion Comanda](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,4,scorpion%20comanda,0) protects the pass and is the first line of defence the [Helviti Wastes](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,1,the%20helviti%20wastes,0) have against invasion. It is widely assumed that if Kathkacha is invaded, [Scorpion Comanda](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,4,scorpion%20comanda,0) would intervene to protect the valley and maintain control over the [Crimson Keep](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,4,scorpion%20comanda,0).

Ruling over Kathkacha are the merchant elite in the city. Corporations and syndicates are in control here, with the most powerful being the Vermillion Hand, led by the canny 'Mistress of Kathkach', [Lady Eyelaine](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,5,lady%20eyelaine,0). Others include Evangeline Stifka of the Seablooded Organisation, Kevin Aldragosh, the administrator of the [Silver Company](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,2,silver%20company,0), and [Brayk Brasshand](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCEH,5,brayk%20brasshand,0), descendant of [Brasshand the Bold](https://5e.warlow.engineer/book.html#BITCPI,8,brasshand%20the%20bold,0), who runs the Brasshand Foundation.

Kathkach is a diverse city, and it primarily inhabited by [humans](https://5e.warlow.engineer/races.html#human_phb), [orcs](https://5e.warlow.engineer/races.html#orc_mpmm), and [dwarves](https://5e.warlow.engineer/races.html#dwarf_phb). It has a sizeable [kobold](https://5e.warlow.engineer/races.html#kobold_vgm) population in the lower town as well as a modest [elf](https://5e.warlow.engineer/races.html#elf_phb) community. It is an attractive place for [wizards](https://5e.warlow.engineer/classes.html#wizard_phb) to move to due to its wealth and quality of life, and in general is a shining jewel of the Pevic Continent.

In order to survive in Kathkacha, one must belong to one of the companies that own everything in the valley, from shares in the wine, copper, and farm industries, to land, to merchant rights. Virtually every aspect of life in Kathkacha can be bought and sold, and this cutthroat mercantile existence can be hostile to many, but appealing to some. It is equal parts vicious and full of opportunity to the canny.
