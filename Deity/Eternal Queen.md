The sun and moon; space, time and the distant stars.Â [The Eternal Queen](https://5e2.warlow.engineer/deities.html#the%20eternal%20queen_gol_bloodinthecompany), the Lady of Eternity, may seem very distant to most common folk, but she is at the same time omnipresent. None escape the darkness of night, nor the blinding rays of the sun at noon.

The Eternal Queen is represented most frequently as a regal and powerful woman. She often towers over other representations of gods; her title is that of Queen, Mistress, Empress of Time and Lady of Eternity. Her titles imply rulership, and she rules without a shadow of a doubt.

Of all the gods, her bright and dim aspects are the most plain to see. If one has ever been frightened by the darkness, that is the influence of the Eternal Queen. If one has been warmed by the rays of the sun, or had their way illuminated by the moon, or been worn down by time, or been awed by the vastness of space, it is her work that has allowed this.

Those who use magic also tend to have an association with the Eternal Queen. Explorers use her stars to guide them, and philosophers ponder the nature of time under her watchful gaze.
