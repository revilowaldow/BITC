The Protector is the noble and heavy-handed patron of law, guards, city walls and the preservation of society and life. He is also the terrible and dark vengeful tyrant of war and fighters.

Commonly represented in cities as a knight in ancient resplendent silver armour, he is typically worshipped by those who devote themselves to the maintenance of public order.
