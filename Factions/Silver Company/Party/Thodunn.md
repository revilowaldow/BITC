Thodunn was an elf
Lost at the battle of looming rock
was in a collapse, touched a rune in a cave
petrified

woke up in the aegan empire
lied about which side of the war he was on
was a soilder for them for years

Piggy was to be his handler in Kathkach
Started feeding them false information from the silver company
Fully switched sides
