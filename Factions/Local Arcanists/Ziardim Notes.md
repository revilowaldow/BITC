# Setting Up the Laboratory

For too long I have been in need of a quiet and disposable location to perform my experiments away from the prying eyes of my mentor and the arcanists of the Eastern cities. This cavern, situated in a neutral zone away from the city, shall suffice. The golems I have brought with me shall assist in clearing the passages whilst I gather the necessary equipment.

I loathe the dampness and the cold, but the benefits of such a place outweigh the negatives. I shall also take precautions regarding any interlopers; Val's memory shall not contain my name nor any experimental details, and should a thief penetrate into the deep caverns, I shall ensure the mining golems are prepared to kill.

The location itself is interesting; the purple ores seem to release a unique powder. Perhaps to a lesser mind the matter of geological curios would be cause to study; I however concern myself solely with matters of cosmic significance.

Perhaps it can be sold to fund my other research.

# Hypothesis

I have received an interesting proposal from an unexpected source; an Aepoptosian, of all individuals, has suggested remarkably insightful theories regarding the elusive topic of Dyvarran reincarnation.

Their words were slick with misunderstanding and exaggeration, however, and I do not trust that a mind addled with fanaticism can be capable of clear rationalisation. Therefore I shall verify the theories myself using my own measuring tools.

The difficulty shall be in procuring a reincarnate; even were they not rare, they are notoriously difficult to subdue without ruining their properties. However, it is my belief that the particular characteristics they display may be distilled, allowing for appropriate observation.

I shall enlist the assistance of our Aepoptosian 'friend' to locate at least six specimens. For simplicity I shall summarize for them a basic set of identifiers for them to use.

- Physical markings (primarily tattoos or ritual scarring)
- Physically fit
- Psychologically troubled
- Possessing a fluid identity
- Female

A candidate possessing four out of 5 traits may be considered for inclusion. Whilst my new assistant sources the specimens I shall perfect the liquification procedure.

Note: the purple powders in the walls seem effective at stabilising fluid matter. I shall use these convenient properties to ensure the souls of the samples are stable within the liquid matter. It may have had an effect on the oozes elsewhere in the caves, rendering them unusually resilient when splitting.
