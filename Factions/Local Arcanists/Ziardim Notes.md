# Setting Up the Laboratory

For too long I have been in need of a quiet and disposable location to perform my experiments away from the prying eyes of my mentor and the arcanists of the Eastern cities. This cavern, situated in a neutral zone away from the city, shall suffice. The golems I have brought with me shall assist in clearing the passages whilst I gather the necessary equipment.

I loathe the dampness and the cold, but the benefits of such a place outweigh the negatives. I shall also take precautions regarding any interlopers; Val's memory shall not contain my name nor any experimental details, and should a thief penetrate into the deep caverns, I shall ensure the mining golems are prepared to kill.

The location itself is interesting; the purple ores seem to release a unique powder. Perhaps to a lesser mind the matter of geological curios would be cause to study; I however concern myself solely with matters of cosmic significance.

Perhaps it can be sold to fund my other research.

# Hypothesis

I have received an interesting proposal from an unexpected source; an Aepoptosian, of all individuals, has suggested remarkably insightful theories regarding the elusive topic of Dyvarran reincarnation.

Their words were slick with misunderstanding and exaggeration, however, and I do not trust that a mind addled with fanaticism can be capable of clear rationalisation. Therefore I shall verify the theories myself using my own measuring tools.

The difficulty shall be in procuring a reincarnate; even were they not rare, they are notoriously difficult to subdue without ruining their properties. However, it is my belief that the particular characteristics they display may be distilled, allowing for appropriate observation.

I shall enlist the assistance of our Aepoptosian 'friend' to locate at least six specimens. For simplicity I shall summarize for them a basic set of identifiers for them to use.

- Physical markings (primarily tattoos or ritual scarring)
- Physically fit
- Psychologically troubled
- Possessing a fluid identity
- Female

A candidate possessing four out of 5 traits may be considered for inclusion. Whilst my new assistant sources the specimens I shall perfect the liquification procedure.

Note: the purple powders in the walls seem effective at stabilising fluid matter. I shall use these convenient properties to ensure the souls of the samples are stable within the liquid matter. It may have had an effect on the oozes elsewhere in the caves, rendering them unusually resilient when splitting.

# Partial Success

Of twenty-eight specimens from across the valley, I was able to reduce the number of viable candidates to six, which I deem sufficient for distillation. Following the liquification process the specimens were harvested and distilled, prior to insertion into the crude clay container prepared.

I am glad to report partial success; whilst the container itself decayed rapidly following the insertion of the distilled fluid, the magical properties were greatly enhanced. Follow-up experiments revealed to me several key factors:

- Identity fluidity is a factor to be considered when identifying dyvarran reincarnates. I posit that this is due to their identities being 'weaker', they are more easily overridden by the outer forces imposing themselves on the candidate.
- Dyvarran reincarnates draw magic energy from a non-Golian source as well as from the immediate surrounding. The stronger the reincarnate, the more energy is drawn from the surrounding cosmos.
- A stronger container is required to continue experimentation on the creation of artificial dyvares.

This bears great significance to me. My ambitions can be made real if sufficient dyvares are harnessed to draw magic back into the world of Gol.

As my new laboratory is being completed, I fear I must abandon this early location. I sense that other powers will be drawn here soon, and all will be for naught if I am exposed too soon. It is a shame I was not able to experiment on the mongrel's pup; by all appearances, it would have made an excellent subject for study.

As time is of the essence I may have to leave some of my samples here. I doubt any normal individual could survive the Dyvarran golem, however, even if its complete immunity to physical damage was compromised by the flawed procedure.
