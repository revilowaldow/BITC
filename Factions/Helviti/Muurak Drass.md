Grizzled human helviti
- Wendigo Comanda, monster hunters, operate solo
- Bounty hunters, thugs for hire
- Contribute to negative helviti reputation, but always get job done
- Light brimmed helmet, travel weight armor
- Hammer made of steel, longbow, shield

Wendigo has never successfully hunted one despite taking contracts
Other expeditions did not go well
Need multiple people to hunt them successfully
