Flambard Hawk is a famous (or notorious) adventurer who roams the continent. Her journeys have often taken her into abandoned castles and ancient towers where rumours of magic still persist. Her daring and wit are often the talk of whatever town she happens to be in.

As a way to enhance her fame, she allows (or spreads) rumours, both true and false, wherever she goes. Salacious stories of trysts with local lords and ladies? Besting [ogres](https://5e.warlow.engineer/bestiary.html#ogre_mm) and [hill-giants](https://5e.warlow.engineer/bestiary.html#hill%20giant_mm) in tests of strength? Single-handedly cutting through hordes of [bandits](https://5e.warlow.engineer/bestiary.html#bandit_mm)? Downing a dozen pints of Friarbarns in one minute? Murder of a [priest](https://5e.warlow.engineer/bestiary.html#priest_mm)? No matter how scandalous, nefarious, or heroic it may be, Flambard allows the tales to be told with mischievous glee. As a result, no less than four books claiming to be the 'true' biography of Flambard Hawk, each with conflicting details, are in publication.

Even Flambard's weapons of choice are unknown. Some swear she prefers to fight with dual [shortswords](https://5e.warlow.engineer/items.html#shortsword_phb); others that she favours an Aegan [heavy crossbow](https://5e.warlow.engineer/items.html#heavy%20crossbow_dmg). More than a handful insist she can somehow fly. Flambard insists on being an unknown quantity in a world where the hidden corners of the world are gradually being filled in.

The only thing everyone can agree on about Flambard is that she never, ever takes her mask off in public.
